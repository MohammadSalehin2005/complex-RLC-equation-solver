# Complex RLC Equation Solver

A web-based solver for systems of equations in RLC circuits with complex numbers.

## âœ¨ Features
- Accepts **rational numbers** (e.g., `3/4`) and converts to decimals automatically.
- Accepts **symbolic Ï‰** (e.g., `j*Ï‰*L` or `1/(j*Ï‰*C)`).
- Automatically computes **impedances** for inductors and capacitors.
- Works for **any number of variables**.
- Shows results in **both rectangular and polar form**.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use
1. Enter the **number of variables**.
2. Fill in the coefficient matrix and constant values.
3. Use fractions, decimals, or symbolic terms with `Ï‰`.
4. Click **Solve** to get the results.
